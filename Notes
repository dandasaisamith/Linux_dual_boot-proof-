My Personal Learning Notes

>> What I Learned About Dual Boot

When I installed Linux, I learned that dual boot means running two operating systems on the same computer. In my case, I installed Ubuntu along with Windows. When the computer starts, the GRUB bootloader appears and allows me to choose whether I want to start Windows or Ubuntu.

How I Installed It (My Experience)

First, I backed up my important files in Windows to avoid losing data. Then I opened Disk Management in Windows and shrank the main partition to create free space for Linux. After that, I downloaded the Ubuntu ISO file from the official website and created a bootable USB using Rufus.

Next, I restarted my computer and booted from the USB drive. During the installation process, I selected the option “Install Ubuntu alongside Windows.” The installer automatically created the required partitions and configured GRUB. After installation was complete, I restarted the system and saw the GRUB menu showing both Windows and Ubuntu. That confirmed my dual boot setup was successful.

Key Observations

Managing disk partitions carefully is very important.

Taking a backup before installation is necessary.

The Ubuntu installer automatically sets up GRUB.

Secure Boot sometimes needs to be disabled in BIOS.

>> What I Learned About Linux Commands

Linux mainly works through the terminal, and I realized it is very powerful. Commands are case-sensitive, so typing must be accurate.

Some basic commands I practiced:

pwd → shows my current working directory.

ls → lists files and folders.

ls -l → shows detailed file information and permissions.

cd → changes directory.

mkdir → creates a new folder.

>> Challenges I Faced

During installation, I was initially confused about disk partitions and was worried about deleting Windows accidentally. I also had to disable Secure Boot from BIOS settings to make the installation work properly. After installation, I needed an internet connection to update packages and install additional software.

Some commands were difficult to remember at first, but after practicing multiple times, I became more comfortable using them.

>> Conclusion

This practical exercise helped me understand:

The complete Linux installation process

How dual boot works with GRUB

Basic terminal navigation

File and directory management

Understanding file permissions

Now I feel confident using basic Linux commands in the terminal and working in a dual boot environment.

touch → creates a file.

sudo → runs commands with administrative privileges.
